CNN is Convolutional Neural Network

What is Convolutional?
 Convolutional is the 180deg rotation of correlation as of maths.
 But in field of computer vision Convolutional is just finding correlation.
 In CNN we have an image assume (6x6) image, we have an kernel (3x3) matrix by moving kernel over image and produce new image is called convolution
